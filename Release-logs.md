# Release logs
## ANN Alpha 2.0
We have created a Neural network that now runs on microcontrollers! This can be customized per your settings, such as input and output nodes, as well as the acceleration of the learning and the error margin. You can also customize the desired input training sets and the targeted output sets as well.
These are some of the recomended microcontrollers that you use to run the ANN on.
* Arduino Nano 33 BLE(Sense)
* Arduino Mega 2560 R3
* ESP32 / ESP32 Wifi
* Arduino Maker Vidor 4000
* RP2040
* MKR WAN 1300

### ANN Alpha 2.0.1
There is a more improved documentation for people to use and understand the code
